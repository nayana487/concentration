1. As a user, I should be able to select two cards to see if they match.
2. As a user, I want two matching cards to be displayed so I know not to select again and that I got that match.
3. As a user, I want non-matching cards to remain hidden so I know that I got the wrong answer and can continue playing.
4. As a user, I want my information organized in a grid so it's easier for me to understand the game.
5. As a user, I want to have the cards randomized so I can play new games.
